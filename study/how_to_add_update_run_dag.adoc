= How to Add/Update/Run DAG
:sectnums:

== Find DAG path & Copy python file to the path

. Airflow Website -> Admin -> Configuration
. the page mentioned configuration file path (file name is `airflow.cfg`)
. search `dags_folder` on `airflow.cfg`. It's DAG path
. copy to the path

== Load/Reload DAG file

. Check loading interval on `airflow.cfg`
    min_file_process_interval:: TODO 정확히 뭐하는건진 잘 모르겠음.
    dag_dir_list_interval:: dag dir을 스캔하는 간격.

. Wait until the interval for DAG is shown on the list


    # Number of seconds after which a DAG file is parsed. The DAG file is parsed every
    # ``min_file_process_interval`` number of seconds. Updates to DAGs are reflected after
    # this interval. Keeping this number low will increase CPU usage.
    min_file_process_interval = 30

    # How often (in seconds) to scan the DAGs directory for new files. Default to 5 minutes.
    dag_dir_list_interval = 300


. If DAG is already added and just source code is changed, Then able to refresh DAG on DAGs webpage

== Run DAG

. Unpause DAG

 When DAG is added, it's pause status. unpause to start scheduler
 Then, DAG is processed from start_date to now.

. Trigger DAG

 If to run manually is required, call this

. Backfill old dates
+
[source,bash]

airflow dags backfill tutorial -s 2021-03-01 -e 2021-03-15
----



== Stop DAG

Unpause DAG to turn off the scheduler

== Delete DAG

. Delete DAG - When file scanning, DAG is added again with pause staus
. Delete DAG file
